assigned to someone.

You can start by finding existing issues with the [good-first-issue](https://github.com/vanus-labs/vanus/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A"good+first+issue") label.
These issues are well suited for a new contributor.

- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- perf: A code change that improves performance
- test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)

### Descriptions

We provide the template for each PR and expect you could explain your PR for what/why/how in detail.
If the PR wants to address one issue, please link to it.

### Testings

We hope you can test well your PR before starting the Code Review. If the PR is about a new feature, refactor or bugfix, the related
Unit tests will be required.

### CI Checking

There are some automated tasks to ensure each PR's reach high quality in Vanus. These tasks are:

- License checker: check if a new source code file includes the 'Apache License 2.0' Header. The auto-generated file isn't required.
- golang-lint: run lint checker to analyze code to find the hidden risk in code.
- CLA checker: checkout if the contributor signed the Contributor License Agreement.
- codecov: run all unit tests and generate unit test report. If any case failed or the coverage number is down, the task will be failed.
- e2e testing: run the e2e testing. Any case that failed will cause the task to failed.

### Code Review

The Code Review can be started until all checking were passed. Each PR will automatically assign reviewers. After getting at least one `Approve` from reviewers, the PR can be merged.
